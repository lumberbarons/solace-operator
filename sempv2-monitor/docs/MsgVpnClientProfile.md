Large transactions consume more resources and are more likely to require retrieving messages from the ADB or from disk to process the transaction prepare or commit requests. The transaction processing rate may diminish if a large number of messages must be retrieved from the ADB or from disk. Care should be taken to not use excessively large transactions needlessly to avoid exceeding resource limits and to avoid reducing the overall broker performance.
