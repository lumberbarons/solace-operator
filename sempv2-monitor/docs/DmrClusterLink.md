**Enabled** | **bool** | Indicates whether the Link is enabled.

**QueueMaxRedeliveryCount** | **int64** | The maximum number of times the Queue will attempt redelivery of a message prior to it being discarded or moved to the DMQ. A value of 0 means to retry forever. | [optional] [default to null]
**QueueMaxTtl** | **int64** | The maximum time in seconds a message can stay in the Queue when &#x60;queueRespectTtlEnabled&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;. A message expires when the lesser of the sender assigned time-to-live (TTL) in the message and the &#x60;queueMaxTtl&#x60; configured for the Queue, is exceeded. A value of 0 disables expiry. | [optional] [default to null]
**QueueRejectMsgToSenderOnDiscardBehavior** | **string** | Determines when to return negative acknowledgements (NACKs) to sending clients on message discards. Note that NACKs cause the message to not be delivered to any destination and Transacted Session commits to fail. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;always\&quot; - Always return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard. \&quot;when-queue-enabled\&quot; - Only return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard when the Queue is enabled. \&quot;never\&quot; - Never return a negative acknowledgment (NACK) to the sending client on message discard. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] [default to null]
**QueueRespectTtlEnabled** | **bool** | Indicates whether the the time-to-live (TTL) for messages in the Queue is respected. When enabled, expired messages are discarded or moved to the DMQ. | [optional] [default to null]
**RemoteClusterName** | **string** | The cluster name of the remote node. Available since 2.17. | [optional] [default to null]
**RemoteNodeName** | **string** | The name of the node at the remote end of the Link. | [optional] [default to null]
**Span** | **string** | The span of the Link, either internal or external. Internal Links connect nodes within the same Cluster. External Links connect nodes within different Clusters. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;internal\&quot; - Link to same cluster. \&quot;external\&quot; - Link to other cluster. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] [default to null]
**TransportCompressedEnabled** | **bool** | Indicates whether compression is enabled on the Link. | [optional] [default to null]
**TransportTlsEnabled** | **bool** | Indicates whether encryption (TLS) is enabled on the Link. | [optional] [default to null]
**Up** | **bool** | Indicates whether the Link is operationally up. | [optional] [default to null]
**Uptime** | **int64** | The amount of time in seconds since the Link was up. | [optional] [default to null]
